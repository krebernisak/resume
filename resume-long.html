<h2 id="interests-skills">Interests &amp; Skills</h2>
<p>I have been reading and writing code, running servers and experimenting with new software since 2004. Most recently, the majority of code I have written has been in Java, JavaScript, and Solidity, but I have experience in many other programming languages and technologies. I am interested in designing and building scalable distributed systems, smart contracts and protocols on distributed networks like Ethereum, as well as native mobile and web clients.</p>
